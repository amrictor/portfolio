  'React': [
    'I have extensive experience with React, working across both modern and legacy codebases. I\'m comfortable designing complex applications using custom hooks and composable logic, as well as maintaining and refactoring older class-based components with traditional lifecycle patterns. I\'ve often bridged the gap between generations of React code, bringing clarity and consistency to large, evolving projects.',
  ],
  'Architecture': [
    'I\'m passionate about software architecture as the blueprint that keeps projects resilient and adaptable. Designing high-level systems requires the balance of a clear strategic vision with enough flexibility to keep codebases both understandable and easy to iterate on. By emphasizing simplicity, separation of concerns, and modular design, I aim to minimize complexity and reduce technical debt.'
  ],
  'Full-Stack': [
    'While my passion lies in front-end development, I regularly pursue projects on which I am responsible for much more. I maintain a robust full-stack toolkit and on the job, it grants me a greater level of autonomy. Being comfortable diving into database schemas and server code means I\'m less dependent on other teams, can troubleshoot issues end-to-end, and communicate more effectively across disciplines.'
  ],
  'Automation': [
    'I tend to seek out process automation as a tool for improving efficiency, reiability, and developer experience. I enjoy identifying opportunities to reduce tedious work through internal tooling and streamlined workflows. I also look to continuous testing not just as a safety net, but as a way to elevate the debugging process and more quickly resolve defects. My goal is to create systems that are easier to work in, more trustworthy, and that leave teams more time to focus on meaningful problems.'
  ],
  'Multimedia': [
    'I\'m drawn to technology as a vessel for creative expression in unexpected ways. I enjoy exploring how code and circuitry can shape and enable my artistic impulses by eliminating traditional constraints. These projects challenge me to think beyond the screen and engage with technology as a medium for storytelling and experimentation. It\'s where my engineering skills intersect with my curiosity and imagination, and where I find a lot of joy in the process itself.'
  ],
  'Accessibility': [
    'I make a point to develop user experiences with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies in mind. I work closely with design teams to catch accessibility issues early and advocate for semantic HTML, thoughtful focus management, and clear visual hierarchy. I always strive to create experiences that are easily navigable by as many people as possible, without compromising any one person\'s experience.'
