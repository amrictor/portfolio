  'React': [
    'I have extensive experience with React, working across both modern and legacy codebases. I\'m comfortable designing complex applications using custom hooks and composable logic, as well as maintaining and refactoring older class-based components with traditional lifecycle patterns. I\'ve often bridged the gap between generations of React code, bringing clarity and consistency to large, evolving projects.',
  ],
  'Architecture': [
    'I\'m passionate about software architecture as the blueprint that keeps projects resilient and adaptable. Designing high-level systems requires the balance of a clear strategic vision with enough flexibility to keep codebases both understandable and easy to evolve. By emphasizing simplicity, separation of concerns, and modular design, I aim to minimize complexity and reduce technical debt.'
  ],
  'Full-Stack': [
    'While my passion lies in front-end development, I regularly pursue projects on which I am responsible for much more. I maintain a robust full-stack toolkit and on the job, it grants me a greater level of autonomy. Being comfortable diving into database schemas and server code means I\'m less dependent on other teams, can troubleshoot issues end-to-end, and communicate more effectively across disciplines—all resulting in smoother, more cohesive delivery.'
  ],
  'Automation': [
    'I tend to seek out process automation as a tool for improving efficiency, reiability, and developer experience. I enjoy identifying opportunities to reduce tedious work — whether through internal tooling, streamlined workflows, or well-conceived continuous test suites. I\'m drawn to testing not just as a safety net, but as a way to elevate the troubleshooting process and more quickly resolve defects. My goal is to create systems that are easier to work in, more trustworthy, and that leave teams more time to focus on meaningful problems.'
  ],
  'Multimedia': [
    'I\'m drawn to creative technology and interactive media as spaces where software becomes tactile, evocative, and playful. I enjoy exploring how code can shape and enable our creative expressions by eliminating traditional constraints and inviting artistic works to be more dynamic. These projects challenge me to think beyond the screen and engage with technology as a medium for storytelling, experimentation, and delight. It\'s where my engineering skills intersect with my curiosity and imagination, and where I find a lot of joy in the process itself.'
  ],
  'Accessibility': [
    'Accessibility is a core part of how I approach building interfaces and I develop user experiences with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies in mind. I work closely with design teams to catch accessibility issues early and advocate for semantic HTML, thoughtful focus management, and clear visual hierarchy. My goal is always to create experiences that are easily navigable by as many people as possible, without compromising any one person\'s experience.'
