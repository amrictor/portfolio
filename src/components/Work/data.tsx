      Extra Life is an organization that facilitates charity events across the continent by providing a platform to 
      receive donations at and an easy system for directing those funds to a local children's hospital. With the support of the Computer Science department at Colorado State University, I had the opportunity to plan and implement a 24 hour Extra Life event on CSU's campus, marketed primarily to
      the students of the department but open to all. I obtained sponsorships and funding from local businesses, coordinated venue needs, and 
      ended up raising over $1000 for a local childrenâ€™s hospital and having a fantastic day filled with all kinds of games (video, 
      board, trivia, roleplaying, etc.).

  //     even in my absence. I served in multiple leadership positions, including Treasurer and Webmaster, for the organization. I also mentored
  //     new leadership after stepping down as an officer.

  //     While working with this organization, I organized, attended, and volunteered for events designed both to foster community amongst 
  //     and create opportunities for women and minorities in Computer Science. We had many outreach projects focussed on introducing STEM
  //     topics at elementary, middle, and high school levels to local students in underserved communities and taught recurring "Binary Bracelets"
  //     workshops to young girls with an interest in STEM at the annual "Expanding Your Horizons" conference in Northern Colorado.
